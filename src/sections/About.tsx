          I enjoy building things that are clear, functional, and quietly reliable. Most of my work sits somewhere between the frontend and backend, with a focus on structure, consistency, and how everything ties together. It's less about doing too much, more about making sure whatever's built actually holds up and stays clean under the hood.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white text-sm leading-relaxed">
          Lately, I've been leaning into projects that mix backend systems, simple UI layers, and background automation. I like when things just work without needing constant fixes. There's always more to learn, but I prefer learning by doing â€” building one thing properly instead of chasing ten things at once.
